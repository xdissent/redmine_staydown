# Redmine Staydown

A killer Markdown formatter for Redmine - hopefully.

## Why?

Because there are far too many half-baked Markdown formatters for Redmine. If 
this plugin has priorities, there are two:

* Keep up with Redmine - *Always* work with current master.
* Mimic Github - Do whatever they do.
* Keep it simple - It's easy to overdo it.

Please send pull requests and with your help, this may be the last time you 
went looking for a stable Markdown formatter for Redmine.

This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.
